# microfrontends-controller
This repository is a (GO) re-implementation of the [Kubernetes Controller] pattern over custom resources specifying front-end web components to be dynamically integrated into a user interface application shell, using operator-sdk. It is heavily inspired by https://github.com/milung/ufe-controller. The project is of educational nature.

This is an experimental concept design of micro-frontends architecture, considering declarative definition of micro-frontends as part of the Kubernetes API custom resource definitions, and leveraging the web components technology. This enables us to approach the development of particular micro-frontends in a similar way as is done with the development of cloud-native microservices.

## Description
The original ufe-controller was implemented in Prolog using the Kubernetes (k8s) client to read the Custom Resources (CRs) called web components. It then aggregates the CRs to a frontend config structure which is then served via a REST endpoint. This config is then used to inject the web components to a frontend application container.

The aim of this project is to use operator-sdk and Golang to recreate what was done in the ufe-controller. It was created as a learning experience to understand how the k8s operators work and how to implement one.

There are two main components in the application: WebComponentController and an API server serving the fe-config.

WebComponentController is reconciling the WebComponent CRs. Currently, it is applying the following logic on a WebComponent:

- Check if the WebComponent still exists.
- If WebComponent does not contain finalizers it adds one so that the controller does its cleanup before the k8s removes the WebComponent.
- It converts the WebComponent to internal MicroFrontendConfig model which in turn is converted to TransferObject and stored in memory to be served through the fe-config endpoint.
- If WebComponent is set to be deleted it removes it also from the in-memory storage so it is no longer a part of fe-config response.

The API server simply takes the last snapshot of the in-memory storage and returns it to the frontend.

### Migration TODO list:
Here is a list of functionality that is provided by the original ufe-controller and whit information of what is implemented in the go alternative:
- [x] An operator observing specific CRs either on specific namespaces or in all
- [x] REST endpoint serving the MicroFrontendConfiguration as JSON (`/fe-config`)
- [x] REST endpoint serving the MicroFrontendConfiguration as JavaScript
- TBD

### Configuration
You can use environment variables to configure the following parameters:
| Env. Variable | Default Value | Description |
|- |- |- |
|BASE_URL| / |Base URL of the server, all absolute links are prefixed with this address|
|OBSERVE_NAMESPACES||Comma separated list of namespaces in which to look for webcomponents to be served by this instance|
|USER_ID_HEADER|x-forwarded-email|incomming request`s header name (lowercase) specifying the user identifier, typically email|
|USER_NAME_HEADER|x-forwarded-user|incomming request`s header name (lowercase) specifying the user name|
|USER_ROLES_HEADER|x-forwarded-groups|incomming request`s header name (lowercase) specifying the list of user roles (or groups)|
|WEBCOMPONENTS_SELECTOR||comma separate list of key-value pairs, used to filter WebComponent resources handled by this controller|

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

> Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running locally
> This will still require a cluster where the CRs will be stored only the processing part will run from your code. Allowing debuging etc.
1. Install CRD into your local cluster
```sh
kubectl apply -k config/crd
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

3. Or if you want to test the namespace observation you can apply namespaced version of the samples:
```sh
kubect apply -k config/samples/namespaced
```

3. Run a debug session using included debug configurations in `.vscode/launch.json` there is one for observing all namespaces and one where you can limit the observed namespaces.

4. Call `localhost:10000\fe-config` to get the MicroFrontendConfigurations created from the CRs.
### Delete CRs
To delete the CRs from the cluster and see the delete logic in the controller:
```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples
```
or if you used the namespaced sample:
```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/namespaced
```
### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:
```sh
kubectl delete -k config/crd
```

### Running on the cluster
. Install CRD into your local cluster
```sh
kubectl apply -k config/crd
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

3. Or if you want to test the namespace observation you can apply namespaced version of the samples:
```sh
kubect apply -k config/samples/namespaced
```

4. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/microfrontends-controller:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/microfrontends-controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
